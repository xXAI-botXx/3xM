# 3xM
Model-Material-Mixture Dataset for Instance-Segmentation

This project contains:
- This project contains helper tools for working with Materials and 3D-Models.
- The generated Dataset
- (The Materials) -> probably not
- (The 3D-Models) -> probably not

### Explanation
(reference to your bachelor work)


### Data-Source

Subset of [Thingi10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/), please see the [Thingi10k Summary.xlsx](Thingi10K Summary.xlsx) to see the creator of these models. I also used a few 3D-models from [polyhaven](https://polyhaven.com/).

The process of finding good fitting models:
- only unique 3D-Models (no double or too similar models)
- the 3D-Model have to be connected (not 2 or more seperated parts)

For Materials I used the paid version from [Brian](https://freepbr.com/).
