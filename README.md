Model-Material-Mixture Dataset for Instance-Segmentation

This project contains:
- This project contains helper tools for working with Materials and 3D-Models.
- The generated Dataset
- (The Materials) -> probably not
- (The 3D-Models) -> probably not

### Explanation
(reference to your bachelor work)


### Data-Source

A subset from the Thingi10K Dataset got sorted. The sort process tried to make sure:
- only unique 3D-Models
- the 3D-Model have to be connected (not 2 or more seperated parts)
